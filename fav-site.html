            <h1>My Favorite Sites</h1>
            <p>These are some of my favorite websites to visit, some of These sites are from 2006 and may not work but I always have a saved copy are a replica of the site. </p>
            <h2>Powder Toy</h2>

            <img src="assets\pictures\powder toy.png"
            title="powder-toy"
            alt="powder-toy"
            widht="350" height="300" />
            <P>The reason I love this website (more like app) is because is allows you to do almost anything and everything with enought time and creativity.<br>Its sandbox that i played with during my free time all thoughout elementary and some of junior high.</P>
            <h2>Here's An Example</h2>

            <img src="assets\pictures\powder toy gif.gif"
            title="powder-toy.GIF"
            alt="powder-toy.GIF"
            widht="350" height="300" />

            <h2>Youtube</h2>
            <p>I probably use this app more than any other website on a day to day basis.<br>I mostly use Youtube to watch and listen to japanpod 101, and other content creators. </p>

            <img src="assets\pictures\youtube.png"
            title="youtube"
            alt="youtube"
            widht="350" height="300" />

            <h2>Spotify</h2>
            <img src="assets\pictures\alan walker.jpg"
            title="spotify"
            alt="spotify"
            widht="350" height="300" />
            <p>Spotify is just a good app/website to listen to music/podcasts in the background without having to worry about switching to a new playlist.</p>
